            <p>Recently I spoke to a mentor of mine in the workspace for advice on how to navigate imposter syndrome,
                and her response triggered this article. TLDR: the best leaders share a balance of humility and
                confidence, along with an openness and willingness to learn.</p>

                reduced feelings of confidence, Imposter Syndrome tends to affect women and people of color because the

            <p>Besides work, another space to grow your coding and analytics skills is in your personal life. What’s
                interesting to you that’s happening right now? For me, I’ve looked at public datasets around healthcare
                and visa timelines during the pandemic. Most recently, I’m diving into how often, level of coherence,
                and in what language I sleeptalk.</p>
